// Central website configuration.
//
// Why this file exists:
// - brand/domain strings were starting to drift across layouts, pages, and docs
// - the site is no longer a single landing page; it now has multiple sections
// - future changes like a hostname move or nav rename should happen in one place
//
// Mental model:
// - content pages decide *what they say*
// - this file decides *what the site is called*, *where sections live*, and
//   *which public GitHub destinations shared UI links should use*
//
// If you rename a section or move a top-level route, update this file first,
// then update any page copy that refers to the old name.

  // Two distinct GitHub URLs — they serve different purposes:
  //
  // githubUrl (org-level)
  //   Used by: Header icon, Footer "GitHub" link
  //   Points to: https://github.com/DiversioTeam
  //   Why: General "find us on GitHub" link — not repo-specific.
  //
  // agentSkillsRepoUrl (repo-specific)
  //   Used by: /community contribution paths (featured repo card, issues, PRs, contributing guide)
  //   Points to: https://github.com/DiversioTeam/agent-skills-marketplace
  //   Why: The /community page has an Agentic Tools contribution section.
  //        Those links must point to the ASM repo where issues, PRs, and
  //        CONTRIBUTING.md actually live. Changing this to engineering-website
  //        would silently break every contribution link on /community.
  //
  // If a future page needs to link to the engineering-website repo itself,
  // add a separate engineeringWebsiteRepoUrl entry at that time.
